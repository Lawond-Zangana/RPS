This code implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using an inheritance hierarchy with an interface, an abstract class, and a concrete class. The user plays against the computer by typing their move, and the game determines the winner based on the defined logic for comparing moves. The program keeps track of the number of games played, as well as wins, ties, and losses for both the player and the computer. The user's input is validated, and if the input is invalid or the user quits, appropriate messages are displayed and game statistics are shown at the end.
